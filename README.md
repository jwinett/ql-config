# ql-config
abighairyspider's Quake Live configuration


Replicate cfg - Generated by QUAKE LIVE. Do not modify

JOE SAYS: You should not copy this to your system as is.

This file would erase your configuation with the "unbindall".

I will be working on pulling out the useful parts into an
autoexec.cfg or something better for my own use which you 
can also modify for yourself.  Fun!

NOTE: This includes snippets I used over the years from
configurations by other players.  The most notable 
configs were by Ketnar, an ASSHOLE, but great player.
He had dozens and dozens of vstr executions.  

I guess his were the examples I learned from.  There are
leftovers in here that don't make sense -- they 
aren't bound and some of the dependency strings
have already been deleted.  You have been warned.
